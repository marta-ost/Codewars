/*
DESCRIPTION:

Implement the method length, which accepts a linked list (head), and returns the length of the list.

For example: Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, length should return 4.

The linked list is defined as follows:

class Node {
  public Object data;
  public Node next;

  Node(T data, Node next) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = next;
  }
  
  Node(T data) {
    this(data, null);
  }
}

Note: the list may be null and can hold any type of value.

Good luck!
